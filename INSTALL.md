Installation
============

Astrochem is written in ANSI C and should compile on most UNIX
platforms including GNU/Linux and Mac OSX.

Pre-requisites
--------------

To compile Astrochem you will need:

1. An ANSI C-compiler (e.g. gcc, icc, etc.).

2. The [SUNDIALS (SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic
   equation Solvers) library](http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/).
   You will need at least version 4.1.0 of the library installed on
   your computer. Version 6.0.0 is not supported yet.

3. The [HDF 5 (Hierarchical Data Format) library](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5)
   library.

4. Python (version 3.4 or later).

5. The
   [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/),
   [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
   and [H5py](http://www.h5py.org) Python modules.  Numpy is
   mandatory, but Matplotlib and H5py are optional. However, Matplotlib and
   H5py are required to use the plotting tools provided with
   Astrochem. Note that H5Py 2.6.0 has a bug which causes the
   formation/destructions routes computed by Astrochem to be
   incorrectly read; use H5Py 2.5.0 instead. All modules are present
   in major Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)  and in Fink or
   MacPorts on Mac OSX.

6. [Cython](http://cython.org). This is required only to use the Python API.
 
Basic Installation
------------------

Astrochem follows the standard GNU installation procedure. A configure
script attempts to find on your system the C compiler, the libraries
and the programs needed to compile Astrochem and creates the
Makefiles. This script is invoked with:

```
./configure
```

By default, the script will look for the gcc compiler. If you want to
use another compiler, you may do so by setting the CC variable, e.g.:

```
./configure CC=icc
```

You may also set some compiler specific optimization options using the
CFLAGS variable:

```
./configure CC=icc CFLAGS=-O3
```

The script will look for the SUNDIALS library in standard directories
(/usr, /usr/local, etc.). If you have it installed in some other
place, e.g. /sw, so you can set the search path as follows:

```
./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/sw/include LDFLAGS=-L/sw/lib
```

You can then build Astrochem by typing:

```
make
```

A test suite is available.  After compiling the library with `make`,
it can be invoked with `make check` at the top level. If you run the
tests and get some failures, please report
[here](http://github.com/smaret/astrochem/issues?labels=Bug).

Astrochem can be installed using the command:

```
make install
```

The default installation directory prefix is /usr/local.  Installing
in this directory will require root privileges on most systems (use
`su` or `sudo`). The installation directory can be changed with the
`--prefix` option to configure.

Optional features
-----------------

Astrochem can use the LAPACK library together with SUNDIALS, which
usually results in better performance than when using SUNDIALS
alone. This can be turned on by specifying the `--enable-lapack` option to
configure, e.g.

```
./configure --enable-lapack
```

Astrochem can be run in parallel on multi CPU (or core)
computers. For this it uses OpenMP compilation directives. If your
compiler supports OpenMP, compilation of the parallel version of
Astrochem can be turn on by specifying the `--enable-openmp` option to
`configure`, e.g.

```
./configure --enable-openmp
```

The configure script accepts some other options.  Run `configure
--help` for more details.
